## Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from e-commerce platforms such as **Amazon** and **Flipkart** to classify the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It serves as an introduction to **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **text classification** using basic machine learning techniques.

###  Project Workflow:

1. **Data Preprocessing using NLP techniques:**

   * **Tokenization** – Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
   * **Stopword Removal** – Eliminating common words (like *and*, *the*, *is*) that do not add significant meaning.
   * **Stemming** – Reducing words to their root form (e.g., *loved*, *loving* → *love*).
   * **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converting text data into numerical form using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.

2. **Model Training:**

   * A **Naive Bayes classifier** is trained on the processed review data to predict the sentiment class.

3. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Performance is measured using:

     * **Accuracy**
     * **Precision**
     * **Recall**
     * **Confusion Matrix**
